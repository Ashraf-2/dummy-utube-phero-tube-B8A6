            <p><span class="font-bold">scope of var:</span> var works like global. var can be
                declared out of function and can use anywhere of the code. and var can be modified inside and outside of
                the function and blocks, and within nested loops. <br>
                <span class="font-bold">scope of let:</span> the scope of let is actually kind
                of 'block'.that means if it declared inside of the block, then it can not be accessible out of the
                block,for example: functions,condtions,and loop _inside of them a let variable can be modified, but
                outside of them,can not be modified previously declared let variable. <br>
                <span class="font-bold">scope of const:</span> this const variable is also a
                block type scope. work like let. but one important thing is that, const variable can not be changed.
                const variable can not be modified also.

            <p>
                <span class="font-bold">Null:</span> Null is used to defined a variable which have no value.if we assign a variable with a
                value once, and if leter we re assign the variable as NULL that means the variable will be null, and it
                will lost its value. In terms of conditionals, NULL and Undefined both are considered as falsy value. <br>

                <span class="font-bold">Undefined:</span> if we assign a variable and if we don't assign its value, then it will be
                undefined. that means, variable which is declearded but not initialized will be undefined. <br> for example: <br>

                <span class="text-center">let s;<br>console.log(s) //will be undefined.<span>
                <br>
                if a property of an object is not exist , and if we call the property of the object, then it will
                console as 'undefined'.
